# redox-.NET-SDK
Software dev kit for .NET applications

This repo contains three projects: 
1. a model class generator that can be used to change the available JSON schema files to C# classes
2. a RestSharp based client that houses the model classes and can be used to manage authorization keys and generate requests to the redox API
3. an example ASP.NET MVC project that demonstrates potential uses of the API client
